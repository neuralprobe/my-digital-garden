- Lessons from Kwik Reading ([my-space](https://my.kwikbrain.com/), [Introduction](https://kwikbrain.com/reading?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=Search+Ads&utm_campaign=Reading+Offer&gclid=Cj0KCQiAt66eBhCnARIsAKf3ZNHNYyNWI5hXnYm6e58mOnrLr9jJkuCpbLCMLg110ojdEjEBcyWmsM4aAvaoEALw_wcB))

# Introduction

- Goal: Reading faster with comprehension 
- Why?: "Leaders are readers"
- Develop better focus, comprehension, retention, enjoyment by setting up good reading habit and mind

---

# FAST Method for Reading

- Forget
	- About your old reading habits
	 - About how you first learned how to read because we are going to learn brand new technique
	- About situational things to focus and concentrate on the course
	- About your limitation because all the behavior is belief driven
- Active
	- Actively involve in reading, not passively
	- Key is consistency
- State
	- State of mind, state of body
	- All learning is state dependent
	- Information combined with emotion becomes a long-term memory
	- So, control your state
- Teach
	- Teach somebody else to learn it better

# Finding Your Starting Place
 
- First, find a book, a fun book, story-driven, something that has a plot ..
- Starting from here and going to move to more technical reading
- In order to manage something, you need to measure it
- Measure "words per minute"
- Harry Potter WPM
	- Jan 21, 2023: 95 words per minute ! 11:30 PM
	- Jan 22, 2023: 154 words per 1 minutes ! 9:30AM
- First thing to do is to set up consistent reading habit. 
- Schedule a time to read when
	- You are most awake , most alert, most focused
	- You have least amount of distraction
	- Just 10 minute slot everyday

# Clearing The Obstacles

- Two parts to improve
	- Reading speed : Train first
	- Reading comprehension

- Three obstacles that makes you a slow reader
	1. Lack of education
		- Reading ability doesn't tell about your intelligence level, because it is just skill that needs a proper training
		- When did you take a class called "Reading"? Mostly, you learned it in elementary school like 7 years old. 
		- If you feel like a slow reader, we were just  taught to read slowly!
	2. Lack of focus
		- Easily distracted like monkey mind?
		- We were not taught to focus properly
		- Fast readers tend to have better comprehension because they focus!
			- If you listen to very slow speaking like "I .... am .... speaking ..... very ..... slowly ", then your mind will be distracted and think other things and seek entertainment elsewhere because the flow of information is too slow to meet the speed of your mind and your mind is not stimulated enough.
			- So, proper speed of reading that match to your mind (which is much faster than your reading skill) lets you focus more on the context of the reading material
	3. Regression
		- Reading once and then Going back and re-reading those words 
		- a.k.a. Back-skipping
		- Problem is that you are doing regression unconsciously. You are not aware of your back-skipping habit
		- Just a bad habit we picked up with our formal education
		- Unlearn that process of back-skipping throughout this program!
		- It's like a person watching TV rewinding for 5 seconds every 30 seconds. That would be really annoying!!
		- The problem of regression is breaking up the momentum and the rhythm of your reading

# How to Use Visual Pacer

## Visual Pacer

- Use a visual pacer like pen, mouse, finger
- You're underlining the words, 
- Not touching the page or the screen
- You don't skip anything
- Your reading skill will boost 25-50%
- Why?
	- Children naturally do it
	- Eyes are attracted to motion
	- Senses work very closely together in associative manner like enjoying smell and taste of food
		- Let your hand, eye, brain neurons work together!
	- Prevent you to do back-skipping!
- At the first stage of training it, you might feel uncomfortable. But push past that. 
- It's not going to be easy, but it's going to be worth it
- Practice it every single day for 10 minutes
- For right now, set comprehension aside for a few days and focus on this mechanical skill called speed reading

- A practicing tool to prevent back-skipping like a tread mill
- Unlearning bad habit of back-skipping
- Harry Potter WPM
	- Jan 23, 2023: 170 words per minute ! 11:00 PM (A little less comprehension ...)
	- 150 WPM $\rightarrow$ 170 WPM

---

# Indentation Reading

- 25% boost with indentation
- Exploit peripheral vision!
- As you grow, you look a character $\rightarrow$ a word $\rightarrow$ a chunk of words at a time
- Don't place your visual pacer all the way the end of left or right side of the book
- In other words, indent your visual pacer movement by left and right side margin ($\sim 1inch$)
- 60 lines x 9 word/line / 3mins = 180 WPM with light comprehension loss
- 52 lines x 9 word/line /2 mins = 224 WPM with poor comprehension

# Infinity Technique

- **An exercise you can do BEFORE you start reading** 
	- to relax your eye muscles and 
	- activate both your left and right brain. 
	- I call this technique, a "lazy-8" or an "infinity technique."

- Draw infinity symbol or lazy-8 character with your finger and track it with your eyes
	- Slower the better!

# Subvocalization 

- Voice in your brain is a supervillain because
	- Your reading speed is limited your speaking speed, 
	- Not by your thinking speed!

- Read by sight, not by your inner voice

- When you're learning new words, it's necessary to subvocalize. You want to know how it sounds and by saying it, you get to store it in your auditory memory as well.  
  
- But what about the times when reading words you already know? You can still process all the information without saying every single one of them.

- One-two-three method to reduce your subvocalization
	- While you read a book, count inside 1, 2, 3 repeatedly, not subvocalize the sentences you are reading
	- At first try, set aside your comprehension.

	- 속으로 읽는 것이 아니라, 부사나 조사는 거의 무시하면서 ==핵심 단어에 초점==을 맞춰가며 읽어나가야함.  
	- 단어에 초점이 안맞춰지는 부분은 ==눈운동==을 통해 개선 가능. 매일 아침 10분씩 눈근력운동하기.
	- 문장 단위로 내용을 정리하는 "==순간의 생각=="을 통해 내용을 정리해가며 읽어나가기.
	- 문단 위주로 의미를 파악해가면서, 중간중간 3-4 문단을 읽고 나면 문단의 의미를 이어가는 "==생각의 이음=="을 해줄 때 이해도가 올라감.
