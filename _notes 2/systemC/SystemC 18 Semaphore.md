# SystemC 18 Semaphore

---


![[Pasted image 20230615150245.png]]

# Semaphore

1. is a predefined **channel** intended to model the behavior of a software semaphore used to provide **limited concurrent access to a shared resource**.
2. has an integer value, **the semaphore value**, which is set to the permitted number of concurrent accesses when the semaphore is constructed.
a) if the initial value is one, the semaphore is equivalent to a **mutex**.

# Member functions of semaphore

1. `int wait()`
	- a) If the semaphore value is greater than 0, `wait()` shall decrement the semaphore value and return.
	- b) If the semaphore value is equal to 0, `wait()` shall suspend until the semaphore value is incremented (by another process).
	- c) Shall unconditionally return the value 0.
1. `int trywait()`
	- a) If the semaphore value is greater than 0, `trywait()` shall decrement the semaphore value and shall return the value 0.
	- b) If the semaphore value is equal to 0, trywait() shall immediately return the value `â€“1` without modifying the semaphore value. (-1 means failure)
2. `int post()`
	- a) shall increment the semaphore value.
	- b) shall use immediate notification to signal the act of incrementing the semaphore value to any waiting processes.
	- c) shall unconditionally return the value 0.
3. `int get_value()`: 
	- shall return the semaphore value.
