# Direct Memory Access

---

- **Direct memory access** (**DMA**) is a feature of computer systems and allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory "Computer memory") ==independently of the [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") (CPU)==.
	- Without DMA, when the CPU is using [programmed input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_input/output "Programmed input/output")
	- Each data item transfer is initiated by an instruction in the program, involving the CPU for every transaction.
	- In contrast, in [direct memory access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access "Direct memory access") (DMA) operations, the CPU is uninvolved in the data transfer.
	- Many hardware systems use DMA, including ==[disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_storage "Disk storage") controllers, [graphics cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_card "Video card"), [network cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller "Network interface controller") and [sound cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card)==.
	- DMA can also be used for "==memory to memory==" copying or moving of data within memory.
