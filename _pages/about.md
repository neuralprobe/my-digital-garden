# My digital garden with Obsidian-Jekyll Workflow

## Welcome to Jong Hoon's digital garden

- This repository is created to run [my digital garden](https://digital-garden.jonghoon.blog/) which is sub-domain of [jonghoon.blog](https://jonghoon.blog/) where I post blogs and library. 

## What do I want from this?

- Following the Zettelkasten philosophy, this site will be used to record my learning history, stacking my own ideas, connecting different notes together, visualizing my thoguth-graph, and finally publish well-refined articles to [my blog](https://jonghoon.blog/).

Below is the original README.md from Max's github for digital gardening newbies. You can build your own digiatal garden by following Max's tutorial.
